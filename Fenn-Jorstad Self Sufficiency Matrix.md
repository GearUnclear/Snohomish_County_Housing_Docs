The Fenn-Jorstad Self Sufficiency Matrix is a tool to help case managers and other providers of housing and social services to track the progress that individual clients are making towards self-sufficiency. Focused on assessing a client's sufficiency level across 16 life domains, this matrix provides an assessment method that encompasses all populations, is user friendly, objectively focuses on each client's current life situation and does not require clinical expertise to administer.

## Introduction

Across Snohomish County, conversations were taking place around how to accurately measure participant progress in human service programs. In response to community demand, the Snohomish County Human Services Department was identified to take the lead on developing such a tool. In 2004, the Snohomish County Self Sufficiency Matrix was developed and implemented. This tool made great strides in beginning to quantify progress and acknowledged that homelessness and poverty are complex issues which require a holistic assessment. However, providers, community agencies and users found that it was not the objective measure that they had hoped it would be. Additionally, the matrix was being implemented in different ways for each program making analysis difficult. Providers indicated that a more objective tool was necessary for consistent assessment of participant progress in reaching self-sufficiency both within individual agencies and across community agencies as a whole. Therefore, the Snohomish County Human Services Department has started with lessons learned from the previous matrix, researched tools that are being utilized in other communities, gathered feedback through focus groups and determined that the community requires a new tool which encompasses all populations, is user friendly, objectively focuses on each client's current life situation and does not require clinical expertise to administer.

## Instructions

The Fenn-Jorstad Self Sufficiency Matrix (Matrix) is intended for human services professionals in social services settings. The Matrix is an assessment and screening tool that captures where a respondent is at any given moment with regards to that respondent's level of self-sufficiency across 16 dimensions, or life domains. These domains are as follows: English Comprehension and English Literacy, Housing, Food, Transportation, Childcare, Children's Education, Employment, Financial/Income, Skills for Daily Functioning, Social and/or Family Support, Security, Legal-Civil, Legal-Criminal, Healthcare, Mental Health, and Substance Use.

Within each of these life domains are four categories into which respondents could be located at the time of assessment: in crisis, at risk, safe, and self-sufficient. The Matrix may be administered by a case manager/service provider in conversation with a client, or it may be completed by a case manager/service provider using clinical notes, case notes, and observations. The Matrix may be administered several times over a period of time to identify whether there has been movement within each life domain. The frequency of administration will depend on the type of intervention in which the client is engaged (i.e., emergency shelter, transitional housing, rapid rehousing, etc.) and will be determined by the parameters of your agency or program's contract.

Each life domain includes a series of indicators developed with Coordinated Entry in mind. Each indicator is specific, objective, and reflects feedback from six focus groups consisting of 33 people from 20 agencies. In some life domains, the respondent needs to meet each of the indicators of in crisis, at risk, safe, or self-sufficient to be located within that category. Example:

**Childcare**
*4: Self Sufficient*
Must meet all of the following:
*   Safe, reliable and sustainable childcare has been obtained for all children in the household requiring childcare with no subsidies.
*   The childcare meets the cultural, structure and setting preferences of the parent/guardian.

In other life domains, they need to meet only one of the indicators of in crisis, at risk, safe, or self-sufficient to be located within that category. Example:

**Childcare**
*3: Safe*
Childcare has been obtained for those children in the household requiring childcare. The childcare is safe, reliable, and sustainable. However, for at least one child, the childcare must meet **one** of the following:
*   Does not meet the cultural preferences of the parent/guardian.
*   The structure and setting do not meet the preferences of the parent/guardian.
*   Is subsidized in full or in part.

This is clearly defined in each life domain and subsequent categories.

Begin with the lowest indicator. Stop as soon as the respondent has met the criteria to be considered in crisis, at risk, safe, or self-sufficient. A Glossary of Terms is included on page iii for all words in italics for your quick reference. The scores in each life domain stand alone and are not to be combined with the scores of other life domains or averaged in any way. While it is recognized that there needs to be flexibility in the administration of the matrix, the indicators themselves and the scoring of the life domains cannot be changed.

When the assessment is complete, complete the Scoring Summary Sheet.

Keep in mind that this tool does not seek to quantify the quality of life, interpersonal skill level, or employability of the respondent. Nor does it determine which areas someone may benefit from services in. This tool focuses solely on the level to which respondents are currently self-sufficient.

The following components necessary to complete the Self Sufficiency Matrix are included:

*   **Page iii:** Glossary of Terms
*   **Page vi:** Interview Tool
*   **Page 1:** Self Sufficiency Matrix
*   **Page 27:** Scoring Summary Sheet

The interview tool on page vi is a suggested tool only. Your agency or program may have other additional assessment tools that it uses to gather information from clients. The interview tool is not presented to take place of these other assessment tools but rather to help fill in any blanks that your agency or program's assessment tool might not gather that would be necessary to complete the matrix. It is expected that you become familiar enough with the matrix that you have a working knowledge of those things that you will need to find out from clients that will be necessary to complete the matrix. The questions in the interview tool are not all encompassing of every single data point in the matrix; it is expected that a client's answers to the interview tool questions will spur additional conversation and questions necessary to gather more complete information.

## Interview for Self Sufficiency Matrix

### Instructions for Using This Interview Guide

The questions below are intended as a guideline for interviewing clients. These questions will allow you to obtain the information that will be needed to complete the Self Sufficiency Matrix. It is important that you use your own professional skills and training to obtain the information in a way that is most comfortable for you and the client. You will need to take into consideration the client's cultural reality; this includes his/her age, gender, religion, sexual orientation, country of origin, race, disability status, socioeconomic status as well as other factors. As the client answers your questions, you may find that there are issues which need to be immediately addressed (for example, mental health issues, safety issues, issues that require CPS/APS involvement.) If you do find issues like these exist, you should follow your agency's protocols and procedures for getting immediate assistance for the client.

### Interview Questions

"As your case manager, I need to ask you a bunch of questions about different areas of your life so that I can figure out what issues you are currently facing. Some of these questions may seem personal but they will help me to help you. Please know that I recognize some of the things that I ask you might be difficult.
